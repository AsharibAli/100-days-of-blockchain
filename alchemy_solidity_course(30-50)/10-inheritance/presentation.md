# Inheritance

- üß± Re-use common patterns and standards easily
- üèóÔ∏è Child contracts inherit functions (except `private`) and state variables
- üß∞ Child contracts also have access to enum, struct, error and event definitions
- üî© Build your functionality on top or override

---

## onlyOwner

üß± you may start see this pattern everywhere:

```js
contract Example {
  address owner = msg.sender;
  uint importantVar;

  function privilegedMethod(uint x) external onlyOwner {
    importantVar = x;
  }

  error NotTheOwner();
  modifier onlyOwner {
    if(msg.sender != owner) {
      revert NotTheOwner();
    }
    _;
  }
}
```

---

## Modular!

```js
contract Ownable {
  address owner = msg.sender;
  error NotTheOwner();
  modifier onlyOwner {
    if(msg.sender != owner) {
      revert NotTheOwner();
    }
    _;
  }
}

contract Example is Ownable {
  function privilegedMethod(uint x) external onlyOwner {
    importantVar = x;
  }
}
```

---

## Import Statements

Think of them like its copy/pasting the code into your file

```js
import "./Ownable.sol";

contract Example is Ownable {
  function privilegedMethod(uint x) external onlyOwner {
    importantVar = x;
  }
}
```

---

## Inherit Functions

Functions will be inherited as well, like `transferOwner`:

```js
contract Ownable {
  address owner = msg.sender;

  // virtual allows this method to be overriden
  function transferOwner(address newOwner) public virtual onlyOwner {
    owner = newOwner;
  }

  error NotTheOwner();
  modifier onlyOwner {
    if(msg.sender != owner) {
      revert NotTheOwner();
    }
    _;
  }
}
```

---

## Override

Override methods to build on the functionality:

```js
import "./Ownable.sol";

contract Example is Ownable {
  event TransferOwnership(address oldOwner, address newOwner);

  // think of virtual and override as compliments,
  // we can override this method because it is declared as virtual in the base contract
  function transferOwner(address newOwner) public override onlyOwner {
    address oldOwner = owner;
    // call the function on the base or parent contract, Ownable
    super.transferOwner(newOwner);
    emit TransferOwnership(oldOwner, newOwner);
  }
}
```
